# 🛡 Lab Vulnerability Scans — Overview

This folder contains results and documentation from four Nessus Vulnerability scans in my personal lab environment.

---

## 🔍 Scans Included
- ![Basic](https://img.shields.io/badge/Basic-Network-blue) **Basic Network Scan** — unauthenticated discovery & baseline  
- ![Win10](https://img.shields.io/badge/Win10-Credentialed-green) **Win10** — credentialed scan (SMB/WMI/WinRM)  
- ![DVWA](https://img.shields.io/badge/DVWA-Credentialed-orange) **DVWA** — web app scan (form-authenticated)  
- ![bWAPP](https://img.shields.io/badge/bWAPP-Credentialed-red) **bWAPP** — web app scan (form-authenticated)

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- Demonstrate scanning methodology: *discovery → unauthenticated → credentialed scans*  
- Highlight manual validation & triage of high/critical findings  
- Provide sanitized artifacts suitable for public sharing

---

## 📁 Structure
Each scan folder (`basic-network/`, `win10-credentialed/`, `dvwa-credentialed/`, `bwapp-credentialed/`) contains:  
- <span style="color:gray;">`raw/` (PRIVATE)</span>: original `.nessus`, raw CSV, verbose evidence  
- <span style="color:green;">`sanitized/` (PUBLIC)</span>: sanitized PDFs, CSVs, redacted screenshots  
- `triage-notes.md`: validation notes & remediation recommendations  
- `README.md`: scan description and findings summary

---

## ⚠️ Guidelines
- `raw/` must **not** be published; `.gitignore` excludes `*/raw/` & `.nessus` files  
- All artifacts in `sanitized/` are safe for public sharing  
- Each scan folder includes `triage-notes.md` for confirmed vs false positives and validation commands
