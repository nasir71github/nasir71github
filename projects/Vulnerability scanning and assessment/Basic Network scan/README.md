# 🛡 Basic Network Scan — Lab Vulnerability Report


**Lab Environment:** Personal Lab VMs  
**Scan Type:** Unauthenticated Network Scan  
**Date:** 17-Sep-2025  
**Prepared by:** Emmanuel Akrofi  

---

##  Executive Summary
This unauthenticated scan establishes a **baseline of network-level vulnerabilities** across three lab machines.

**Key Observations:**  
- Windows VM (192.168.56.104) is relatively secure.  
- Web app VMs (192.168.56.102 & 192.168.56.103) contain multiple High and Critical vulnerabilities, as expected.  
- Only network-level checks were performed (no credentials).

**Overall Recommendation:**  
- Prioritize remediation of Critical/High findings.
- Review Medium findings for configuration improvements.  
- Perform credentialed scans for full coverage.
- Harden configurations (disable default credentials, enforce strong encryption).

##  Scope
- **Target Hosts:** 192.168.56.102,192.168.56.103,192.168.56.104 
- **Scan Type:** Unauthenticated network discovery  
- **Objective:** Identify open ports, running services, and baseline vulnerabilities  
- **Exclusions:** None (all lab VMs included)

##  Tools & Methodology
- **Tools Used:**  
  - Nessus Essential (scanner)  
  - Nmap  (service verification)
  - Evilwirm (windows vulnerability confirmation)  

- **Methodology:**  
  1. Enumerate hosts in subnet.  
  2. Perform service discovery.  
  3. Detect known vulnerabilities and classify severity using CVSS v3(Nessus).  
  4. Export raw results and generate sanitized reports.  

- **Limitations:**  
  - No credentials used → cannot detect missing patches or configuration issues.  
  - Possible false positives on filtered services.

##  Vulnerability Summary

| Host | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Info | Notes |
|------|---------|------|--------|-----|------|-------|
| 192.168.56.103 | 6 | 22 | 8 | 0 | 106 | DVWA — purposely vulnerable |
| 192.168.56.102 | 6 | 4 | 12 | 4 | 102 | bWAPP — purposely vulnerable |
| 192.168.56.104 | 0 | 0 | 29 | 0 | 0 | Windows VM — relatively clean |

## Conclusion
The scan identified several vulnerabilities of varying severity. Addressing the **Critical** and **High** findings should be prioritized to reduce the risk of exploitation. Continuous monitoring and periodic scanning are recommended as part of a proactive security program.
