## 1️⃣ Purpose
This document records the **manual validation and triage** of vulnerabilities detected during the Basic Network Scan.  
It distinguishes between **confirmed issues** and **false positives**, with supporting evidence where applicable.  

---

## 2️⃣ Triage Table

| Host | Vulnerability | Severity | Status | Validation Method | Evidence / Screenshot |
|------|---------------|---------|--------|------------------|----------------------|
| 192.168.56.103 | OpenSSH 7.9p1 | Medium | ✔ Confirmed | `ssh -v`, nmap service scan | `sanitized/screenshots/ssh.png` |
| 192.168.56.103 | Apache 2.4.29 | Medium | ✔ Confirmed | Manual access, banner grab | `sanitized/screenshots/apache.png` |
| 192.168.56.102 | ProFTPD 1.3.1 | High | ✔ Confirmed | Manual FTP login attempt | `sanitized/screenshots/ftp.png` |
| 192.168.56.104 |

## 3️⃣ Summary
- **Total Hosts Scanned:** 3  
- **Confirmed Vulnerabilities:** 4 

**Key Insights:**  
- Most Critical/High issues were identified on web application VMs (expected due to intentionally vulnerable design).  
- The Windows VM (192.168.56.104) showed primarily informational findings. 
- Credentialed scans will provide deeper coverage and confirm patch levels.  

---

## 4️⃣ Next Steps
1. Remediate confirmed High vulnerabilities (e.g., ProFTPD).  
2. Perform credentialed scans for OS patching and configuration checks.
