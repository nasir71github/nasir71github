## 1️⃣ Purpose
This document records the **manual validation and triage** of vulnerabilities detected during the Basic Network Scan.  
It distinguishes between **confirmed issues** and **false positives**, with supporting evidence where applicable.

## 2️⃣ Triage Table

| Host | Vulnerability | Severity | Status | Validation Method | Evidence / Screenshot |
|------|---------------|---------|--------|------------------|----------------------|
| 192.168.56.103 | Samba Badlock | High | ✔ Confirmed | `smbclient -L //192.168.56.103 -N` (anonymous login; Samba banner shows `Samba 3.0.28a`)| `link` |
| 192.168.56.102 | VNC server weak password ("password") | Critical | ✔ Confirmed | Manual login test via `vncviewer` using password `password`; confirmed successful login| |
| 192.168.56.102 | SSL Version 2 and 3 Protocol Detection | Critical | ✔ Confirmed | Manual `nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers` confirmed SSLv3 and TLSv1.0 enabled with weak ciphers  | |
| 192.168.56.104 | SMB Signing not required | Medium | ✔ Confirmed | `nmap -p445 --script smb2-security-mode 192.168.56.103` shows signing is **not required** |  |
| 192.168.56.103 | SNMP Agent Default Community Name (public)    | High     | ✔ Confirmed  | `snmpwalk -v2c -c public` successfully retrieved system info, confirming weak SNMP configuration. |  |

## 3️⃣ Summary
- **Total Hosts Scanned:** 3  
- **Confirmed Vulnerabilities:** 4 

**Key Insights:**  
- Most Critical/High issues were identified on web application VMs (expected due to intentionally vulnerable design).  
- The Windows VM (192.168.56.104) showed primarily informational findings. 
- Credentialed scans will provide deeper coverage and confirm patch levels.  

---

## 4️⃣ Next Steps
1. Remediate confirmed High vulnerabilities (e.g., ProFTPD).  
2. Perform credentialed scans for OS patching and configuration checks.
