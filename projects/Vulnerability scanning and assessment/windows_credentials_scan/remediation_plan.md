# Remediation Plan – Windows Credentialed Scan

This remediation plan categorizes vulnerabilities by severity level and provides recommended actions.  
The prioritization follows industry best practices (Critical → High → Medium → Low → Informational).

---

## Critical (Immediate Action – 0 to 7 Days)
- **Apply all missing Windows security updates**, including cumulative updates (e.g., KB5025221) to address Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-28275, CVE-2023-28250, CVE-2023-21554).  
- **Upgrade Microsoft Edge** to version 121.0.2277.83 or later to patch known Chromium-based vulnerabilities.  
- **Migrate Microsoft Office** installations to a **supported channel** to ensure ongoing security patching.  
- **Remove unsupported or end-of-life software** immediately where upgrades are not possible.  

---

## High (Short-Term – Within 30 Days)
- **Patch outdated third-party applications** (e.g., browsers, runtimes, utilities) to mitigate privilege escalation and information disclosure risks.  
- **Harden Windows services** by disabling unnecessary roles (e.g., SMBv1, legacy protocols).  
- **Enforce secure configurations** for system services and registry keys based on Microsoft and CIS benchmarks.  
- **Update vulnerable libraries and middleware** used by installed applications.  

---

## Medium (Medium-Term – Within 60 Days)
- **Review account and permission settings** to eliminate overly permissive access.  
- **Ensure encryption protocols** (TLS 1.2 or later) are enforced for network communication.  
- **Audit firewall and endpoint protection rules** to align with least-privilege principles.  
- **Address weak security configurations** (default credentials, missing logging).  

---

## Low (Long-Term – Within 90 Days)
- **Optimize configurations** for performance and security (e.g., disabling verbose debug logs).  
- **Deprecate legacy features** that could increase the attack surface over time.  
- **Harden group policies** to strengthen workstation security baselines.  

---

## Informational (Best Practices – Ongoing)
- **Document patch cycles and remediation efforts** for compliance and audit purposes.  
- **Perform regular vulnerability scans** (monthly or quarterly) to track remediation progress.  
- **Maintain an updated asset inventory** for all hardware and software.  
- **Provide security awareness training** for IT staff and end users.  

---

## Summary
By following this severity-based remediation strategy, the organization can:  
- Immediately reduce exposure to critical threats.  
- Gradually harden systems against privilege escalation and misconfigurations.  
- Maintain a long-term secure baseline through continuous monitoring and best practices.
