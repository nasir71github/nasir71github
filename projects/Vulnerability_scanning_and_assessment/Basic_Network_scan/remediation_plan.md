# üõ° Basic Network Scan ‚Äî Remediation Plan

**Lab Environment:** Personal Lab VMs  
**Scan Type:** Unauthenticated Network Scan  
**Date:** 17-Sep-2025  
**Prepared by:** Emmanuel Akrofi

## üî¥ Critical Severity
Issues that allow **immediate compromise** of systems or data.  
**Examples:**  
- Default or weak credentials (e.g., `admin/admin`)  
- Remote code execution vulnerabilities  
- Outdated services with known exploits (e.g., Apache Struts, EternalBlue)  

**Remediation Actions:**  
- Immediately patch or upgrade vulnerable software.  
- Disable unused or unnecessary services.  
- Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication.  
- Restrict external access to sensitive services with firewalls/ACLs.  

---

## üü† High Severity
Vulnerabilities that provide **significant access or privilege escalation** if exploited.  
**Examples:**  
- Weak encryption protocols (SSLv3, TLS 1.0, RC4)  
- Unpatched services with denial-of-service or data exposure risks  
- Misconfigured remote services (e.g., SMB signing disabled)  

**Remediation Actions:**  
- Apply vendor security patches promptly.  
- Disable legacy protocols and enforce TLS 1.2/1.3.  
- Harden service configurations following CIS benchmarks.  
- Regularly review and update access controls.  

---

## üü° Medium Severity
Vulnerabilities that require **local access, social engineering, or chaining with other flaws** to exploit.  
**Examples:**  
- Information disclosure (verbose banners, software version leaks)  
- Default community strings in SNMP  
- Services running with unnecessary privileges  

**Remediation Actions:**  
- Reduce unnecessary information disclosure (hide version banners).  
- Change default SNMP/management credentials.  
- Apply least-privilege principle for services and accounts.  
- Monitor logs for unusual activity on these services.  

---

## üü¢ Low Severity
Findings that have **minimal direct risk** but can provide reconnaissance value.  
**Examples:**  
- Open but unused ports  
- Outdated software without known exploits  
- Self-signed certificates on internal systems  

**Remediation Actions:**  
- Close or filter unused ports.  
- Keep software updated as part of routine patch management.  
- Replace self-signed certificates with trusted CA-signed certs where feasible.  

---

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Informational Findings
No immediate risk, but useful for attackers in **mapping and reconnaissance**.  
**Examples:**  
- Detected services, OS fingerprints  
- Internal IP disclosure  
- Debug information in web responses  

**Remediation Actions:**  
- Review and ensure only necessary information is exposed.  
- Monitor changes in these findings over time to catch misconfigurations.  

---

## ‚úÖ Strategic Recommendations
- Address **Critical and High findings immediately** as a priority.  
- Medium and Low findings should be planned for remediation during regular patch cycles.  
- Conduct **credentialed scans** for deeper visibility into missing patches and misconfigurations.  
- Implement a **continuous vulnerability management program** with regular rescans and tracking.
