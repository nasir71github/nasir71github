# ðŸ“„ Executive Summary

## Overview
A credentialed vulnerability assessment was conducted against a Windows 10 host in a controlled lab environment.  
The objective was to evaluate the systemâ€™s security posture by leveraging authenticated access, which enables the scanner to enumerate deeper configuration issues, missing patches, and privilege-related vulnerabilities not visible through unauthenticated scans.

## Key Findings
- **Total Vulnerabilities Identified:** 482  
  - ðŸ”´ **Critical:** 50  
  - ðŸŸ  **High:** 219  
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Medium:** 29  
  - ðŸ”µ **Low:** 184  

- **Authentication Status:** Successful (SMB credentialed login)  
- **Impact:** The large number of critical and high findings indicates the host is significantly exposed to potential exploitation. Many of these issues relate to missing security updates, outdated software components, and weak system configurations.

## Business Risk
If this system were in a production environment, the identified vulnerabilities could:
- Allow attackers to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges  
- Enable remote code execution and malware deployment  
- Lead to data loss, disruption of services, or compromise of the wider network  

## Recommendations
1. **Prioritize remediation of critical and high-severity vulnerabilities** â€” particularly missing patches and privilege escalation flaws.  
2. **Implement a regular patch management process** to reduce recurring exposures.  
3. **Harden system configurations** (e.g., disable legacy protocols, enforce strong authentication).  
4. **Re-scan post-remediation** to validate that vulnerabilities have been addressed.

## Conclusion
The credentialed scan successfully highlighted systemic weaknesses within the Windows host.  
Addressing these issues will significantly reduce the attack surface and strengthen overall resilience against cyber threats.  
This project demonstrates the importance of authenticated scanning for accurate vulnerability detection and serves as a practical example of professional assessment methodology.
