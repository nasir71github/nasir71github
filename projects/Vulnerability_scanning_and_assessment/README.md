# 🛡 Lab Vulnerability Scans — Executive Overview  

## 1. Introduction  
This repository contains the results and documentation from vulnerability scans conducted in a controlled personal lab environment. Scans were performed using **Tenable Nessus**, focusing on both unauthenticated (baseline) and credentialed (in-depth) assessments.  

The purpose of this work is to:  
- Demonstrate vulnerability assessment methodology  
- Compare unauthenticated vs credentialed scanning approaches  
- Provide sanitized artifacts suitable for professional portfolio use  

All testing was conducted on privately owned lab machines.

## 2. Scan Scope  
The scans included two main assessments:  

- [**Basic Network Scan**](./Basic_Network_scan/) — Unauthenticated scan of three lab VMs, identifying open services and potential surface-level vulnerabilities.  
- [**Windows 10 Credentialed Scan**](./windows_credentials_scan/) — Authenticated scan of a Windows 10 host using SMB/WMI/WinRM, providing deeper insight into patch compliance and system configuration.

## 3. Methodology  
1. **Discovery Phase**  
   - Identified active hosts and open ports across the lab network.  

2. **Basic Network Scan**  
   - Ran an unauthenticated Nessus scan against the three lab VMs to establish a baseline of exposed services and vulnerabilities visible without credentials.  

3. **Credentialed Scan (Windows 10)**  
   - Performed a credentialed scan against a Windows 10 machine to enumerate installed software, missing patches, misconfigurations, and local vulnerabilities not visible externally.  

4. **Result Sanitization**  
   - Sensitive host/IP data was redacted to ensure findings are safe for public sharing.

## 4. Results Summary  
| Scan Type               | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Info |  
|--------------------------|----------|------|--------|-----|------|  
| Basic Network (3 VMs)   |   7     |  10   |   34    |  12  |  237   |  
| Windows 10 (Credential) |   50      |  219   |   29    |  0  |  184   |  

⚠️ *Credentialed scans consistently revealed more vulnerabilities than the unauthenticated baseline, especially around missing patches and unsupported software.*

## 5. Key Insights  
- **Credentialed scanning provides richer and more accurate data** compared to unauthenticated scans.  
- **Patch management** remains the primary security gap — outdated Windows patches and unsupported software were recurring findings.  
- **Surface-level scans understate risk** since they cannot detect local or privilege-related vulnerabilities.

## 6. Skills Demonstrated  
Through these scans, I was able to practice and demonstrate:  

- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Running unauthenticated and credentialed scans with Nessus.  
- **Credentialed Scanning Setup**: Configuring SMB/WMI/WinRM for authenticated Windows 10 scans.  
- **Enumeration & Verification**: Validating findings using tools such as `nmap`, `snmpwalk`, and `smbclient`.  
- **Analysis & Reporting**: Categorizing findings by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info) and writing professional triage notes.  
- **Remediation Planning**: Drafting actionable remediation steps aligned with severity levels.  
- **Result Sanitization**: Cleaning sensitive data for safe public portfolio publishing.  
- **Documentation**: Structuring findings into reports suitable for professional review.

## 📝 Handling Guidelines  
- Only sanitized outputs (summaries, redacted evidence) are published here  
- Each scan folder includes both:  
  - **findings report** (`findings.md/Triage.md`)  
  - **remediation plan** (`remediation-plan.md`)
