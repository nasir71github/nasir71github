# 🧪 Malware Static Analysis – VB.NET Packed Loader (`mal17.exe`)

---

## 🧰 Overview
This project documents a **static malware analysis** of a suspicious Windows executable named **`mal17.exe`**.  
The analysis was conducted in a **Remnux sandbox** using open-source forensic and reverse engineering tools to reveal its structure, obfuscation techniques, and intent — all **without executing the malware**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify the **true purpose** of the executable  
- Uncover its **packing and obfuscation mechanisms**  
- Extract any **embedded payloads or resources**  
- Determine potential **C2 (Command and Control)** indicators  
- Document the **analysis workflow** for reproducibility  

---

## 🧩 Summary of Findings
- The malware is a **VB.NET-based packed loader/dropper**  
- Employs **multi-layer Base64 encoding** and likely **XOR encryption**  
- Impersonates **WinRAR 64-bit** to evade suspicion  
- Exhibits **very high entropy (7.9+)**, confirming heavy obfuscation  
- Extracted and decrypted a **secondary payload** (`decrypted_payload.exe`), also a .NET executable  
- Designed for **payload decryption and in-memory execution** (reflective loading)  
- Likely establishes an **HTTPS connection** to a remote **C2 server**
- **Threat assessment:** High — capable of stealthy persistence, remote communication, and second-stage payload execution.

## 🧩 Behavior & Capabilities (Static)
- **Multi-stage loader:** Hosts and decrypts a second-stage .NET payload from resources.  
- **Resource packing:** Stores payload and configuration inside `.rsrc` (resx) with heavy encoding.  
- **Obfuscation:** Chained Base64, probable XOR, AES-128 (observed encrypted blob decrypted during analysis with a recovered key).  
- **In-memory execution:** Code patterns indicate reflective loading / execution without writing clear payloads to disk at runtime.  
- **Persistence artifacts:** Mutex creation observed in decompiled code; registry-modification routines referenced.  
- **Network:** Decoded configuration strings include partial URLs; likely uses HTTPS to contact C2.
